# From CSV into KeePass 2 XML

This is a simple Ruby script that will convert any CSV file into an XML document
compatible with the KeePass 2 format.

```sh

$ ./csv2keepassxml --help
Usage: csv2keepassxml [options] <path>
    -g, --group NUM                  Column number of categories
    -n, --notes NUM                  Column number of notes
    -p, --password NUM               Column number of passwords
    -t, --title NUM                  Column number of titles
    -u, --username NUM               Column number of usernames
    -U, --url NUM                    Column number of URLs
    -d, --dbname NAME                Name of the database
    -H, --[no-]header                Parse a CSV with/without header
    -M, --macoskeychain              Parse the output of CSVKeychain
    -h, --help                       Prints this help
    -v, --[no-]verbose               Be verbose
```

Column numbers are one-based (the first column of the CSV file is column number
1). If your CSV does not contain some data (e.g., it does not have a column with
notes), simply leave out the corresponding option.

Option `-M` is specifically for importing CSV files generated by
[CSVKeychain](https://github.com/lifepillar/CSVKeychain). If you use `-M` you
do not need to specify any column mappings.

At the time of this writing, as far as I know the only app on macOS that can
import XML files into a KeePass database is [KeeWeb](https://keeweb.info).
[MacPass](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass) has an XML import feature under
development.

If you know about a macOS KeePass app importing CSV directly, please let me
know!
